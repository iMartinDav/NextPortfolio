            <div>
              Edge deployments leverage distributed computing to bring data and
              services closer to users, reducing latency and improving response
              times. This approach is particularly beneficial for real-time
              applications and services that require rapid data processing and
              delivery. By minimizing the distance data travels, edge
              deployments enhance user experience and can also reduce bandwidth
              costs.

            <div>
              On-premises deployments are hosted locally on a company&apos;s own
              servers and infrastructure. This approach provides organizations
              with greater control over their data and applications, enabling
              them to meet specific security and compliance requirements. While
              on-premises deployments offer enhanced security and privacy, they
              require significant resources to maintain and manage, making them
              less flexible and scalable than cloud or edge deployments.
